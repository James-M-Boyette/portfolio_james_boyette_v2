#### This is my "2.0" personal site
- In 1.0, I simply needed basic functionality, and to remove all extranious elements
- In 2.0, I have completely overhauled the css to make the site both personalized and fully-funcitonal across multiple platforms and devices. 
> Integrated Twitter API
> Linked to basic blog (which is currently in pre-1.0 state) categories
> All styling is aimed at a) communicating my personality and asthetic clearly, as well as b) demonstrating a keen sense of UX

- Once my blog is updated to 1.0 status, I will merge this and the blog as much as possible using a common domain address
- Ideally, my website's blog section will have catgeory-specific posts pushed to it whenever they're published
